# Gesture-Based YouTube Control System

## Overview
The **Gesture-Based YouTube Control System** allows users to control YouTube playback using hand gestures, eliminating the need for traditional input devices like a mouse and keyboard. This system enhances accessibility, improves user experience, and increases operational efficiency, especially for users with limited mobility.

## Key Features
### 🎯 **Intuitive Gesture Control**
- Enables hands-free interaction with YouTube using hand gestures.
- Supports common playback controls like play, pause, volume adjustment, and navigation.
- Uses **MediaPipe** for hand tracking and **PyAutoGUI** for simulating keyboard and mouse actions.

### 🔄 **Increased Efficiency & Productivity**
- Eliminates the need for physical input devices, improving usability.
- Enhances workflow for users consuming video content while multitasking.

### 💰 **Cost-Effective & Open-Source**
- Built using **MediaPipe** and **PyAutoGUI**, making it affordable and easy to maintain.
- No reliance on proprietary software, ensuring flexibility and adaptability.

### 🛠️ **Enhanced Scalability & Performance**
- Modular codebase with separate components for model architecture, utilities, and Flask API.
- Logging and debugging mechanisms for continuous improvement in gesture recognition accuracy.

### 💤 **Sleepiness & Absence Detection**
- Automatically pauses the video when the user is not actively engaged.
- Reduces unnecessary resource consumption and ensures uninterrupted viewing when needed.

### 🌍 **Accessibility & Inclusivity**
- Provides an alternative input method for users with limited mobility.
- Enhances YouTube usability for a broader audience.
